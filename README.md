This site was created to explore concepts in Stanley Kubrick's The Shining with content by Lawrence Ratna.

Site features:

CSS3 keyframes for logo, header and hover animations - in particular the good ol' card flip.

SVG animations using snaps.svg and stroke offset animation.

HTML5 video.

A little bit of Jquery for the layout and responsivity.
